## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved
     Farmers can choose the right crop,fertilizers and pest management strategy,reducing dependency on guesswork.Incresed productivity and income in higher yields and lower input costs directly improve farmer livelihoods.Improved farming efficiency contributes to national food supply and reduces rural poverty.Solving this problem will empower the farmers with knowledge,make agriculture more sustainable and ensure economic growth in rural India.

Expected Outcomes

1. AI-powered disease detection through mobile image uploads.
2. Voice-based interface in regional languages to overcome literacy barriers.Available as a smartphone and basic phone (IVR/SMS) solution for wider accessibility.
3. Integration with local weather stations, soil sensors, and remote sensing data to deliver farm-specific advice.
4. Pest and disease alerts using image recognition via simple smartphone cameras.
5. Irrigation scheduling using weather forecasts and evapotranspiration models.
6. Crop selection based on soil type, historical yield data, and market demand.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Farmer households – better income stability, improved food security.
• Consumers – consistent supply of quality produce at stable prices.
• Agricultural traders / marketplaces – benefit from predictable crop availability. 
• Local agri-input dealers & cooperatives – align supply with farmers’ actual needs.
• Research institutions & agricultural universities – supply disease databases, soil health insights, and weather/climate models.
Weather stations, soil sensor providers, and satellite data providers – key data sources for accurate advisories.

Supporting Data

•AI-powered pest and disease detection helps reduce crop losses by up to 40% (FAO estimates).
Weather-based advisories improve irrigation efficiency by 25–40%, conserving water and reducing input costs.
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
<ul><li>The solution leverages **AI-powered disease detection**, **voice-enabled interfaces in regional languages**, and **integration of weather, soil, and remote sensing data** to provide farm-specific, real-time advisories. Farmers can upload crop images via smartphone, or receive voice/SMS/IVR-based updates on basic phones. The system delivers guidance on disease management, pest control, irrigation scheduling, and crop selection, tailored to local conditions.</li>
<li>Overcomes **literacy and accessibility barriers** by using regional language voice support. - Provides **early detection of pests and diseases**, reducing crop losses. - Ensures **optimal water usage** through irrigation scheduling based on weather and soil data. - Helps farmers make **better crop selection decisions** using market trends, soil type, and yield history. - Increases overall productivity, reduces risks, and improves income stability for farmers.</li>
<li></li></ul>*AI image recognition** with **multi-channel advisory delivery** (smartphone app + IVR/SMS for basic phones). - Uses **real-time integration** of local weather stations, soil sensors, and remote sensing data for precision farming. - Provides **voice-based interaction in multiple regional languages**, bridging the literacy gap. - Offers **data-driven, personalized recommendations** instead of generic advisories. - Scalable and adaptable across different crops, regions, and farmer profiles

## Technical Approach
<ul><li>Farmers upload crop images via smartphone; AI/ML models identify diseases and pests with high accuracy.
Voice & Multi-Language Support:IVR and voice-based advisory in regional languages ensure accessibility for farmers with low literacy or basic phones.Data Integration:Weather stations, soil sensors, and satellite/remote sensing data are integrated to generate localized and farm-specific insights.Irrigation & Crop Advisory Models:Evapotranspiration models and historical yield/market data guide irrigation scheduling and optimal crop selection.
</li></ul>

## Feasibility and Viability
<ul>Technical Feasibility: The project leverages widely available technologies such as AI, smartphone apps, IVR, SMS, and IoT devices (soil sensors, weather stations). Existing machine learning models for crop disease detection and pest identification can be adapted.<li></li>
<li>Financial Feasibility: Development and deployment costs are moderate compared to the long-term benefits of increased crop yield, optimized resource usage, and farmer income.
Legal and Regulatory Feasibility: No major legal barriers exist for implementing AI-based advisory services in agriculture; compliance with data privacy laws </li>
<li>Economic Viability: Higher yields and reduced input costs translate to improved farmer income, making the solution financially sustainable.
Market Viability: There is strong demand among farmers for accessible, reliable, and actionable agricultural advice, especially in regions lacking extension services</li></ul>
